/**
 * Amazon has N Buildings on the site ranging from 0 to N-1.
 * Every employee has an office space in one of the buildings.
 * Now employee may make request to move from current building X to another building Y.
 * A moving request is noted by
 * class Request {
 * 	String employeeName;
 * 	int fromBuilding;
 * 	int toBuilding;
 * }
 * Initially all buildings are full.
 * A request from building X to building Y is achievable only if someone in Building Y makes an achievable request to move therefore creates a vacancy.
 * Given a wishlist of requests help us plan for the best way of building swaps.
 * A plan that fulfills maximum number of requests is considered the best.
